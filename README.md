# Youtube_music_downloader
Download a whole playlist from youtube into mp3 files directly in your Music directory with or without a special folder. Usefull to download albums' artists

Pr√©requis : installer youtube-dl 
            installer ffmpg (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjtmgCb8NcE)

Some errors may occure : ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
Fix it by writing "youtube-dl --rm-cache-dir" in the console

Problem now fixed but I leave this comment to remember in case of need.

Use : python pathTofile\main.py URL Folder
folder argument is optionnal, if you put it, it will download content directly into this folder. Else it will download into music directory on youre computer
